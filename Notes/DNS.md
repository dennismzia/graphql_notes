## notes to remember regrading DNS

• A: This record maps a hostname to an IPv4 address
• AAAA: This record maps a hostname to an IPv6 address
• MX: This record is used to specify the (e)mail exchange servers for the domain
• NS: Contains the name servers for the domain
• CNAME: Specifies the canonical name (alias) for the domain or a sub-domain
• PTR: Used to resolve an IP address to a hostname
• RP: Used to specify the responsible person for the domain
• TXT: This record allows the domain owner to specify a text record, which is commonly used to validate ownership of the domain
• SRV: Used to specify a service port
• SOA: This record is used for storing administrative information about the domain
Public DNS servers are available to anyone on the internet and usually contain a copy of the DNS records for many registered domain names.
